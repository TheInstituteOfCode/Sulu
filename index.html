            Every element of the shoot is customisable to bring your vision to
            life. 
        long-description: "Photography is one of the most important elements of a brand’s marketing, it’s the thing that immediately captures your potential customers eye and they have already decided their perception of you from the first images they see - before they even bother to read any of your carefully written copy. \L\LWhether your brand is soft and feminine or edgy and bold we pride ourselves on being able to capture the essence of your brand in every way that matters. \n\nEvery element of our shoot can be tailored to suit your brand vision. \L\LOnce you book your shoot you’ll receive our detailed shoot planning guide that covers all of the options in detail (including some that you probably never even considered) including: \n\L- background color (choose any Pantone or hex color)\L\n- solid or transparent background\L\n- lighting setup (for example soft even glow, bright sunlight, or dark & moody)\L\n- shadow (none, soft, sharp, directional)\L\n- props & styling\L\n- models poses & expressions \L\L\n\nIn our creative and per hour scenes you have even more flexibility - want your kombucha captured “in the rain”, or your model to on a staircase to nowhere surrounded by clouds, or literally anything else you can dream up? \L\LYou bring the vision, we’ll bring it to life for you (or let our creative team handle the full creative direction & moodboards too).\L"

        title: Repeatable Results
        short-description: >-
            We track everything and guarantee consistent results across every
            shoot.
        long-description: >-
            Consistency is everything. Whether you’re shooting your first
            collection or your fifteenth, we ensure your images look like they
            belong together, perfectly aligned in lighting, crop, aspect ratio,
            and tone.


            Behind the scenes, we’re meticulous about documenting every
            technical detail from your shoot, from light placement and camera
            settings to backdrop hue and framing guides, so we can recreate it
            flawlessly every time.


            That means when you launch a new product line or refresh a campaign
            months later, your visuals will still feel cohesive and current.
            You’ll be able to mix and match content seamlessly across seasons,
            platforms, and collections without ever worrying about mismatched
            colors or off angles.


            It’s all part of our process to make sure your brand always looks
            like your brand — polished, professional, and effortlessly
            consistent.

        short-description: >-
            We deliver on time, without stress and keep you updated every step
            of the way. 
        long-description: >-
            We know that great creative work depends just as much on clear
            communication as it does on beautiful imagery. That’s why we’ve
            built a streamlined process designed to keep everything organized,
            on schedule, and stress-free.


            From the moment you book your shoot, you’ll receive a clear workflow
            and timeline outlining every step — from pre-production and styling
            to shooting, review, and final delivery. We’ll keep you updated at
            every stage, with check-ins, previews, and an image review process
            that ensures you’re part of the journey without ever having to chase
            updates.


            Our structure allows us to deliver high-quality results, every time,
            exactly when we say we will. It’s creativity with precision — and
            peace of mind built in.

            We organise everything from the perfect model to props & styling
            right through to retouching. 
        long-description: >-
            With Suluh, you don’t need to manage a dozen moving parts. We take
            care of every detail, from creative direction and moodboards to
            model casting, props, styling, photography, and post-production, all
            under one roof. 


            All you need to do is send us your products and share your
            preferences — we’ll handle everything else. Whether it’s a simple
            e-commerce shoot or a full editorial campaign, our team manages the
            process from start to finish so you can focus on running your
            business while we bring your vision to life.


            Think of us as your complete creative department, ready to plan,
            produce, and deliver the visuals your brand deserves (at a fraction
            of the cost).
