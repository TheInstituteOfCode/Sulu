        q: Natural Light Model Photography
        a: >-
            <p>Soft, natural, and effortlessly elevated — our natural light model photography captures your products in a way that feels organic, authentic, and beautifully refined.</p>
            <p>Shot within our studio grounds using real sunlight, we work with both strong directional light and soft diffused tones to create a look that feels modern and honest, without losing the polished Suluh aesthetic.</p>
            <p>This style is perfect for brands that want a clean, natural-feeling lookbook that feels at home on social media yet elevated enough to double as a minimalist campaign.</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Plan your shoot:</strong> We’ll start with a call with one of our experienced shoot producers to get to know your brand, collection, and goals for the shoot, and walk you through exactly what to expect.</li>
                <li><strong>Moodboard & shotlist:</strong> Next, we’ll create a detailed shoot plan that covers everything from lighting direction and location choice within the studio grounds, to backdrop selection, model poses, and styling notes. You’ll see exactly what’s being captured before we start, so there are no surprises.</li>
                <li><strong>Send your garments:</strong> Drop them off to our Bali studio or ship them through our trusted local and international partners. Our team will steam, style, and prepare each piece ready for the shoot.</li>
                <li><strong>We shoot:</strong> Our team handles everything from lighting and direction to styling and model management. Working with natural light creates subtle variations in each image as the light shifts throughout the session, bringing an organic sense of depth and realism to your collection.</li>
                <li><strong>Review & delivery:</strong> Once edited, your images are uploaded to a private gallery for your review and final approval before delivery.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Throughout the process, we keep you updated every step of the way, so you can relax knowing your shoot is in expert hands.</p>
