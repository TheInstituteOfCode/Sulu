            <p>The pricing is simple: just <strong>$55 per image.</strong></p>
            <p>Most brands choose to capture 3–4 images per product (front, side, back, and detail) for a complete, professional presentation.</p>
            <p>This rate applies to furniture that can be easily moved and positioned by one person, generally under <strong>1 metre in size</strong> and <strong>20 kilograms in weight.</strong></p>
            <p>For larger or heavier items that require extra staff for setup or placement, an additional handling fee may apply.</p>
