        a: >-
            <p>Our process is designed to make your food shoot seamless from start to finish.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Plan your shoot:</strong> We’ll start with a creative briefing call to understand your brand, recipes, and vision. From there, our team will create your moodboard and visual direction.</li>
                <li><strong>Pre-production:</strong> We’ll plan your shoot around your menu or product list, including lighting, props, and plating notes. You can choose to prepare dishes yourself or add our in-house chef and assistant for full meal preparation.</li>
                <li><strong>Shoot day:</strong> Your creative team includes a photographer, creative director, production manager, and two assistants. You’ll have exclusive use of our commercial kitchen, prop library, and studio spaces, with multiple complimentary backdrops available — from timber tables to marble benchtops and tiled splashbacks.</li>
                <li><strong>Review & delivery:</strong> After editing and retouching, your final images are uploaded to a private gallery for review and approval.</li>
