        q: How It Works
        a: >-
            <p>Our lifestyle campaigns are designed for full creative flexibility — so you can bring your concept to life exactly the way you imagine it.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Plan your shoot:</strong> We’ll start with a creative briefing call to understand your brand vision, target audience, and campaign goals. From there, our creative team develops the concept and visual direction.</li>
                <li><strong>Pre-production:</strong> We’ll create a detailed moodboard and shoot plan covering set design, lighting, shotlist, and styling notes. You can choose from our existing studio spaces and props or have us build a custom set just for your campaign.</li>
                <li><strong>Shoot day:</strong> Your shoot will include a full creative team — lead photographer, creative director, production manager, and 2x shoot assistants — all working to deliver a cohesive, high-impact result. You’ll have complete flexibility throughout the day to experiment with poses, angles, and lighting setups.</li>
                <li><strong>Review & delivery:</strong> Once your final images are edited and retouched, we’ll upload them to a private gallery for your review and approval before delivery.</li>
            </ol>
