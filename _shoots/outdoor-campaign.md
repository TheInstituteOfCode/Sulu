        q: Outdoor Lifestyle Campaign
        a: >-
            <p>Step outside and you’ll find textured limestone walls, lush gardens, a mediterranean courtyard and a rooftop with 12+ hours of direct sunlight. </p>
            <p>Our outdoor lifestyle shoots make the most of Suluh’s one-of-a-kind studio grounds — from Mediterranean-inspired terraces and minimalist marble gardens to our mid-century pool and rooftop bathed in tropical sunlight.</p>
            <p>Every space is designed to give you cinematic variety within a single location, so you can create a dynamic, editorial-style campaign without ever leaving the studio.</p>
            <p>It’s the perfect option for fashion, lifestyle, swimwear, and beauty brands looking for a look that feels natural, aspirational, and unmistakably alive.</p>

        q: How It Works
        a: >-
            <p>Our outdoor campaigns are built for creativity, movement, and storytelling.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Plan your shoot:</strong> We’ll start with a creative briefing call to understand your vision, target audience, and campaign goals. From there, our creative team develops your moodboard and visual direction.</li>
                <li><strong>Pre-production:</strong> We’ll plan your shoot based on your preferred outdoor locations, lighting style, and aesthetic. You can choose from a range of backdrops — from terraces and rooftops to pools and gardens — or mix and match to create visual variety.</li>
                <li><strong>Shoot day:</strong> Your full creative team — including photographer, creative director, production manager, and 2x shoot assistants — will bring the concept to life. Natural light offers rich variety throughout the day, giving your images a dynamic, sun-kissed feel.</li>
                <li><strong>Review & delivery:</strong> After editing and retouching, your images are uploaded to a private gallery for your review and approval.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Throughout the process, our team manages every detail so you can focus on your brand vision.</p>
