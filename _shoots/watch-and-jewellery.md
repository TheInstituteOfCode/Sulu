            <ol>
                <li><strong>Plan your shoot:</strong> We’ll start with a call with one of our experienced shoot producers to get to know your brand, collection, and goals for the shoot, and walk you through exactly what to expect.</li>
                <li><strong>Moodboard & shotlist:</strong> Next, we’ll create a detailed shoot plan that covers everything from lighting and reflection control to background colours, angles, and styling. You’ll see exactly what’s being captured before we start so there are no surprises.</li>
                <li><strong>Send your products:</strong> Drop them off to our Bali studio or ship them through our trusted local and international partners. Each piece will be carefully handled, cleaned, and prepared before the shoot.</li>
                <li><strong>We shoot:</strong> Our team uses specialised lighting setups, reflectors, and macro lenses to capture every fine detail with perfect clarity, ensuring your pieces look polished and luxurious.</li>
                <li><strong>Review & delivery:</strong> Once edited, your images are uploaded to a private gallery for your review and final approval before delivery.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Throughout the process, we keep you updated every step of the way so you can relax knowing your products are in expert hands.</p>
