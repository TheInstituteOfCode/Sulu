        q: What we do
        a: >-
            <p>The essential ecommerce shots you need to showcase your products to the world. Start with the classic front, back, and side angles or get adventurous with interesting backdrops and creative combinations of images — the choice is yours.</p>
    -
        q: How we do it
        a: >-
            <p>First we’ll have a call to run you through the process and make sure you understand exactly what to expect while we learn your preferences.</p>
            <p>Then we’ll put together a detailed moodboard and shotlist that includes everything from how the product should be styled to your choice of backdrop and lighting. We’ll outline every shot you need so that during the shoot everything flows smoothly and you know upfront exactly what you’re getting.</p>
            <p>During this planning phase we’ll clarify the best workflow for your shoot, including whether we’ll share live previews during the session and whether we’ll select and deliver the best images for you or share multiple options for you to choose from.</p>
            <p>Once that’s confirmed, you’ll send us your products — via courier like GoJek if you’re on the island, dropped off to our studio in person, or shipped using one of our international logistics partners. We’ll complete an inventory check, and if your moodboard includes any advanced styling or positioning, we’ll share iPhone test shots for approval before shooting.</p>
            <p>During the shoot, our team handles everything from styling your product (including steaming or assembling as needed) to ensuring every detail is captured exactly the way you want.</p>
            <p>After the shoot, we’ll professionally edit each image to match your brand guidelines or moodboard, including any retouching that’s needed. Images are uploaded to a virtual gallery for your review and approval, and once you’re 100% happy, we’ll optimise and deliver them in a neatly organised folder ready to use.</p>
            <p>See our detailed workflow here.</p>

        q: What’s included
        a: >-
            <p>Our flat-rate product photography offers affordable, transparent pricing starting at $35 per image.</p>
            <p>This includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Shoot planning, moodboard and shotlist creation</li>
                <li>Experienced photographer and photography assistant</li>
                <li>Studio rental with professional lighting</li>
                <li>Access to a range of complimentary backdrops</li>
                <li>Image editing with accurate colour matching</li>
                <li>Professional retouching</li>
                <li>Consistent background tones or transparent cut-out background</li>
                <li>Lifetime commercial license for all images</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For example, if you want to capture the front, back, side, and detail shots, you would book four images per product.</p>
            <p>This rate applies to products that can be shot on a flat surface. Large or complex items that require advanced styling or positioning (such as hanging or floating) will be quoted separately.</p>
            <p>Pricing is based on a minimum of three images per product and a minimum of ten products per shoot. For smaller collections, get in touch and we’ll recommend the best package. For shoots with over 30 products, bulk discounts are available.</p>

            <p>The standard turnaround time for our product photography is eight business days. If you need it faster, let us know your deadline and we’ll share expedited options to deliver in as little as 48 hours.</p>
            <p>If your product requires advanced retouching (for example, fixing broken or unclear labels), this may extend the turnaround slightly, but we’ll always inform you in advance.</p>
