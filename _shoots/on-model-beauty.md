        q: On-Model Beauty & Jewellery Photography
        a: >-
            <p>Add personality and human connection to your brand with on-model beauty and jewellery photography.</p>
            <p>We capture elegant close-ups that highlight how your products look and feel when worn — from delicate earrings and layered necklaces to bold statement rings and beauty products in use.</p>
            <p>Each image is composed to feel refined and consistent, while still giving your brand that touch of emotion and storytelling that’s hard to achieve with flat-lay product shots alone.</p>
            <p>Whether you’re building a cohesive e-commerce catalogue or creating a luxury lookbook, we’ll help you showcase every product in context — beautifully, naturally, and true to your brand.</p>
