        q: Headless Catalog Photography
        a: >-
            <p>Timeless, unrecognisable imagery that keeps the focus entirely on your product.</p>
            <p>Our headless (also known as anonymous) catalog photography captures your garments fitted on a real professional model, cropped to keep attention on the shape, texture, and details of your design.</p>
            <p>This style is clean, consistent, and ideal for e-commerce or brand lookbooks where you want to show real fit and form without the distraction of faces or strong expressions.</p>
