            <ol>
                <li><strong>Plan your shoot:</strong> We’ll start with a call with one of our experienced shoot producers to get to know your brand, collection, and goals for the shoot, and walk you through exactly what to expect.</li>
                <li><strong>Moodboard & shotlist:</strong> Next, we’ll create a detailed shoot plan that covers everything from mannequin styling and garment preparation to backdrop colours, lighting style, and angles. You’ll see exactly what’s being captured before we start, so there are no surprises.</li>
                <li><strong>Send your garments:</strong> Drop them off to our Bali studio or ship them through our trusted local and international partners. Each piece will be steamed, styled, and ready to shoot.</li>
                <li><strong>We shoot:</strong> Our team handles everything from lighting and styling to capturing every angle according to your shotlist, ensuring each garment is perfectly fitted and evenly lit.</li>
                <li><strong>Review & delivery:</strong> Once edited, your images are uploaded to a private gallery for your review and final approval before delivery.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Throughout the process, we keep you updated every step of the way, so you can relax knowing your shoot is in expert hands.</p>
